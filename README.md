# weatherapp

### **A weather app with location Geolocation and manual search functionality using Openweather API** ###

Live Demo - https://timwf.github.io/weatherapp/

**Features -**
* Geolocation and manual search
* Current weather and five day forecast
* Bespoke dynamic svg icons and background images depending on weather conditions/time of day
* Sunrise and sunrise, and 5 day forecast times showing local time in any location

## Purpose 

New to React - to understand React in more detail.

## Dependences - Libraries

Open Weather API, React JS `create-react-app`, fontawesome 

## Things I've learnt

**1. Unix time and JS**
  * working with JS and unix is a nightmare! 
      `getTimezoneOffset()` was used to offset convertion to local time from timestamp (will look at using librarys for future projects)
      
**2. React Life Cycles**
  * When and how to use life cycle methods such as `componentDidMount()` and `componentDidUpdate(prevProps)`
  
**3. ES6 review and practice**
  * understanding arrow functions and how `this` binds, using template literals and general ES6 features
  
  ## Things I'd like to do if I get time ##
  
  1. Live search results for locations on input
  
  2. Tidy styling (this was a quick project focused mainly on React JS)
  
  3. Crossbrowser and bug testing (developed using Chrome)
  
  4. Add wind speed and direction (using `transform: rotate` with direction image)
  
  5. General code refactoring
